<p>The stage coach stopped at the door of
the Academy in Abington, an hour later than
the expected time, and Howard and George
Barrington ran forward with eagerness, as
school boys are wont to do, when they are
going from a retired part of the country into
the city, at the Christmas Holidays.</p>

<p>The stage passed rapidly along the fine
turnpike road; and at dusk the blowing of the
horn announced their near approach to the
great city; soon the coachman’s whip was
thrown on the top of the vehicle, a loud ring
at the door of their father’s mansion was answered
by the servant in waiting; the boys
beheld the cheerful lighted hall, and were
soon locked in the arms of their parents and
sisters, who ran out of the parlour to receive
them. The parlour too was lighted, not only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
with lamps, but by a blazing hickory fire, for
it was a cold, frosty evening, toward the end
of December. “What kept you so late?”
said Emma to her brother George, whose
hand she still held. “I believe,” said he,
“we were not longer than usual in coming,
but the stage did not leave Abington for an
hour after the appointed time; it was waiting
for passengers, and was very much crowded.”
“I thought you would never come,”
said Emma.</p>

<p>Howard, who had been in earnest conversation
with his mother, now turned to George,
and said, “Did you not feel sorry for poor
John when he found he could not get into the
coach? I really pitied him, for he was
just as eager to go as we were; and I could
not help thinking what a disappointment it
would be to his parents, who, no doubt, were
looking out as anxiously for him, as our parents
were for us.” “O, don’t think about it,
Howard,” said George. “I dare say he’ll get
down to-morrow, and that will do as well.”</p>

<p>Before we proceed, we will give the reader
a little insight into the characters of these
boys: Howard, the eldest, (who was named
after the great philanthropist of that name,)
was twelve years old, slender and delicately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
formed; his capacity was good, his disposition
amiable and obliging, and his school
mates called him the finest fellow in the
world. He possessed, indeed, genuine sensibility;
that sensibility which feels the misfortunes
of others, as well as its own sorrows.
This latter quality, though a lovely one, subjected
him to a great many trials; and one of
the objects his judicious mother had in view in
sending him from home, was to counteract this
tendency to morbid feeling; she did not wish
to crush the beautiful germs, which, if properly
directed, might at some future period,
make him the benefactor of mankind; but
she wanted his strength of mind to keep pace
with his benevolent feelings, and she found,
the only way to accomplish this, was to throw
him upon his oars, (to use a sea phrase,) and
compel him to think and act in a great measure
for himself. The school and the family
provided for him, were every way unexceptionable.
The teacher was a clergyman, past
the middle of life, of exemplary piety, one
who possessed great suavity of manners, and
who had the happy faculty of attaching his
pupils to him in an extraordinary degree.
He was made acquainted with Howard’s peculiar
temper, and suited himself to it; treating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
him with great kindness, yet, with that
firmness he so much required.</p>

<p>George Washington, called after the beloved
father of our country, was almost the opposite
of his brother; yet we will not take away
from him the commendation he deserves, for
he too had his good qualities, and at ten years
old, was called by most folks, a smart and
brave fellow. He was short and chubby,
with the promise of very good talents; bold
and daring, and of a quick, passionate temper,
which continually wanted a curb. His
parents had early been aware of this, and by
discreet management, had so far kept him
under complete control. When out of their
sight, however, he would sometimes <em>break out</em>,
and <em>get into scrapes</em>; his brother was then his
refuge, for the respect shown to him, even at
this tender age, generally ensured peace, and
the culprit was forgiven.</p>

<p>Providence, who is ever watchful over the
affairs of life, apparently designed these lads
to be blessings to each other. If George was
sometimes betrayed into rashness by the
boldness of his nature, the same confidence
was exerted to raise his brother from his desponding
fits, as he laughingly termed the tenderness
Howard discovered for the human
woes he felt, or saw around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>After greetings all round had taken place,
and the domestics also had welcomed their
young masters home, the tea-table was set
out; and George, who was generally on the
look out for something good, saw to his great
pleasure, a nice plum cake placed in the middle
of the table. It was Mrs. Barrington’s desire
to make her children happy. She did not
approve of giving them luxuries at all times,
because health is best promoted by plain food,
but <em>at this time</em>, she thought she might innocently
allow them a few indulgencies, as her
circumstances in life were affluent, and she
was not compelled to rob the poor, in order
to afford her children the gratification. They
were soon seated at the tea-table. Emma and
the two little ones were permitted on this
evening to join the group, in honour of the
arrival of their brothers. They were two
sweet cherub-looking children; the one three
years old, had a very fair complexion, and
glossy flaxen hair, which hung in curls on
her little shoulders,—and such is the effect
of habit, or imitation, that the moment she was
placed at table, she put her little hands on
it, closed her soft blue eyes, and was ready
for the blessing her father was to ask; never
was there a sweeter picture of innocent loveliness:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
the young folks had a great deal of
merry chit-chat round the table; after the
tea things were removed, the two younger
children were sent to bed—Emma remained
an hour longer.—Mamma then directed the
servant to place the table nearer the fire, and
to add fresh fuel to it—the green cloth was
then thrown over the table, the newspapers
were placed on it for papa, and sewing materials,
and interesting books for the rest of
the party. They were tolerably quiet, while
papa was reading, only now and then George
would forget that he was not in the woods at
Abington, and Emma would whisper a few
words in his ear, which would make him laugh
out. Soon, however, Dr. Barrington went into
his office, a very neat room, which adjoined the
parlour. The children tenderly loved their
father, yet they were not sorry to see him go
away for a little while; the respect they
likewise felt for him, did not produce restraint;
but yet they were generally rather
silent when he was present, because they
could not bear to interrupt him. They knew
his mind was almost always engaged with
some important duty. He was a physician,
and in truth, even the few hours he gave to
domestic enjoyment, were not without their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
cares: when surrounded by an attractive circle,
which his reputation had drawn around
him, he was oftentimes compelled to think
deeply: he was responsible for the lives of
his fellow creatures, and was conscientious
in the discharge of every duty to them. After
he withdrew, their little tongues were all
in motion. “Come, come, my children,”
said Mrs. B., “it is my turn to be speaker
now;” a cry of hush! hush! went round, and
soon they were all mum. Mamma then addressed
them, “I have been thinking, my
dear boys, and Emma too, what Christmas
box I should get for you. Your father and
myself were talking over this weighty matter
before you came home, intending to surprise
you; he, however, thought it best, as
you are all now of an age to have some judgment
of your own, to let you choose for yourselves.”
“And me too, mamma?” said little
Emma. “Yes, my dear,” said her mother,
“you will go with your brothers, and Howard,
if not George, can surely advise you.”
“Dear, dear mamma,” vociferated the trio, “how
good you are!” “and will you give us the money
in our own hands,” cried Emma? At
that moment she drew from her reticule a
nice purse, and presented each of them with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
a beautiful new bank note. Their father had
sent to the bank for them that day, on purpose
to have them fresh; but mamma said to
little Emma, after she had sufficiently admired
her possession, “now, my dear, as you
are a little girl, you had better let Howard
take care of your treasure, till the purchase
is about to be made.” She did as she was requested
to do, and then a debating took
place. Many articles were named for the
purchase, but for some, the sum was too little,
and others would not cost so much. In this
state they went to bed, to dream of every
thing delightful. As they were leaving the
apartment, after having affectionately bade
their mother good night, she called to them,
and said, “now remember, my dear children,
you have but one day more to decide upon
your purchase before Christmas, and remember
too, you must think well, before you decide;
and after you have fixed upon the articles
you intend to buy, you must not change
your mind. It must also be all concluded
upon before you go to the shops, so that you
may not give unnecessary trouble, and expose
yourselves, as many little boys do, who
cannot make up their minds. I would be
pleased too, if you would talk the matter over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
among yourselves, and appeal neither to your
father nor myself for advice.” They promised
to do all their mother advised, and retired.</p>

<p>They had sweet dreams, as may be supposed,
and appeared at the breakfast table
the next morning, with fresh blooming complexions,
and countenances full of meaning.
This was an eventful day to them. They behaved
very well considering all things; but
George found it difficult to keep the interesting
subject out of sight; and Emma would
every now and then, put her head close to
his, and whisper something in his ear. Howard
would cast a significant look across the
table, and father and mother could not but
smile. In truth, these good parents were as
happy as any king or queen, nay, far happier;
for monarchs seldom feel the delights which
spring from the social affections.</p>

<p>Dinner time now came round, the party
were on <em>tip-toe</em>. As they all took their seats,
Mrs. Barrington looked at them with much
earnestness. She thought she discerned a
little anxiety on Howard’s brow, and George
seemed restive. But this might arise from
impatience to be out; it was three o’clock, and
they would have but two hours before sunset.
She, however, took no notice of this, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
bidding the servant hasten the dessert, she
told them they might withdraw in a few minutes,
without waiting, as was their custom,
till the cloth was removed,—away they flew,
were soon coated, and sallied forth.</p>

<p>The grand decision was made; they went
to a number of shops—made their purchases,
and just as it began to grow dark, they rang
at the hall door, in high glee. Mrs. Barrington
was seated on the sofa in the drawing
room, when the door opened, and Emma first
made her appearance, holding behind her a
beautiful red morocco work box, which she
produced as soon as she came near her mother.
“See, mamma,” said she, “this was
Howard’s choice; he thought it would be more
useful than any toy: and I think, mamma, I
shall be able to keep it a great while; see, it
has thimble, scissors, needle case, and all in
it.” “Yes, it is very complete,” said her
mamma, “and very well chosen, for it is plain,
and strongly made: now, if it only encourages
you to be industrious, I shall be rejoiced.”
“O yes, mamma,” said Emma, “I
mean to begin to hem your cambrick handkerchiefs,
this very evening, and will furnish
my pretty box with needles, pins, cotton balls,
&amp;c.” Just at this moment in came Howard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
and George, and Mrs. B. could scarce refrain
from laughing; the mingled sensations
at the same time affected her, when the latter,
with a military air, marched in, with his
small barrelled gun, saying, “now I can be a
sportsman, and by next Christmas, mother,
you shall have as fine a brace of partridges
as ever graced a gentleman’s table, or if you
like them better, wood-cocks, or pheasants, or
reed-birds; I dare say you will like them the
best, they are so delicate. Mother, you look
grave,” said the sprightly boy; “why it is not
worth while, for I’m sure both General Washington
and General La Fayette, handled a gun
before they were my age, or else they never
would have known how to frighten the British
so; come, cheer up mother, may be I may
be a General some of these days.”</p>

<p>The gun was only moderately commended;
it was very good of its kind, his father
said, (who by this time had come into the parlour
to witness the scene,) and not a dear purchase;
but Mrs. Barrington did not like to
see it in George’s hand; she would not have
felt so much fear had it belonged to Howard.
However, the purchase was now made; she
had told them they must not change their
minds after once deciding; so nothing more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
could be done at present; but she intended
making an appeal to his feelings when he returned
into the country, and she hoped this
would be regarded.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take out your pretty
books,” said Emma to Howard, as he stood
looking at the gun, with very much the same
train of thought as that which agitated his
mother. With that he took from his coat
pocket two very neat volumes, and handed
them to his mother; one was a very good
edition of Walker’s Dictionary, the other a
neat pocket edition of The New Testament.
He coloured as she opened this, and with his
usual timidity, turned away. He had stepped
into his father’s office, and that was the
reason why he and George did not enter the
parlour with Emma, that he might write in
the title page of his Testament, “<em>A Christmas
gift from my dear mother</em>, may her son
derive profit from the perusal of it, that he
may become a blessing to her.” When she
saw these lines, tears started to her eyes;
and an involuntary ejaculation of, “Heaven
bless you, my son,” escaped from her lips. “You
have done well,” she replied. “O that is not all
yet,” exclaimed little Emma. “No,” said George,
“for the gentleman at the Sunday School Bookstore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
seemed so pleased with him, that he
allowed him to take the books at such a low
price, that he had almost a dollar left.” Saying
this, he ran behind Howard, and drew
from his coat pocket, a striped woollen jacket.
Here the party laughed aloud. Dr. Barrington,
who seemed to enjoy the frolic, said, “why
here is a sailor’s jacket, but where are the
trowsers and hat? are you going, my dear boy,
to turn sailor upon our hands?”</p>

<p>Howard’s feelings were by this time, a
little touched; and George took upon himself,
to clear up the mystery of the yellow
jacket. “Howard,” he said, “had from the first,
wanted to get something for poor Tom Sanders,
who lives near our school: and sometimes
he thought he would lay out all his money
for him, he looked so ragged and distressed
the day before we came away. But he had
wished for a great while, to have a small
Testament of his own, beside his school Testament,
that he could carry in his pocket,
and he thought if he had it, he could sometimes
between school hours run through the
woods to the house of Tom’s father and mother,
who were poor wretched creatures, and
by this means be of some service to them and
Tom too; and the Dictionary he thought he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
could scarcely do without, but he had given
this up, intending to lay out what he had left
after buying the Testament, for poor Tom:
but the gentleman let him have the Dictionary
so cheap, that he found he could get the
jacket too. So we stopped at a shop and
got it.” Dr. B.’s eyes beamed with pleasure,
and Mrs. B. felt as if she could have
taken Howard to her arms. “My son, you
have done well,” exclaimed the father, “and
Tom shall have a pair of trowsers to suit the
jacket.” “O, shall he,” says he, “then, dear
father, I’ll run now and get them.” “No,
my dear, you are fatigued. It is beside,
snowing fast. Harry shall go early in the
morning, before you are up; very little
choice is required.” “He may take the
jacket with him, father, may he not,” said
Howard; “for Tom will be as well pleased
to have them alike, as I should be. And
father, do you think we could get the
stage driver to take them to-morrow, so that
he might put them on <em>on Christmas day</em>?”
“Harry shall go with a request from your
mother, and I have no doubt he will take
them.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barrington at the same time gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
them in charge to the man servant, and added
a nice fat little turkey, for the poor family.
When Howard saw this, he felt that his mother
was good indeed, to gratify him so highly:
the next day, they were all despatched in
time to reach the house of Tom’s father, at
a very early hour. So that Tom had the
comfort of his new clothes on <em>Christmas day</em>,
and the family had as good a dinner as their
richer neighbours. When the stage stopped
at the door of the cabin, and the driver handed
out the bundle, Tom’s surprise was so
great at first that he could not speak; but he
ran in to his mother, exclaiming, “only look
mammy, what master Howard has sent us.
Here’s a jacket and trowsers for me, and
here’s a turkey for you and father!”</p>

<p>But we must return to the parlour in town.
Christmas eve now came, and with it a small
company, consisting of the children of persons,
with whom Dr. and Mrs. B. were particularly
acquainted, and beside them their
cousins. Mrs. B. loved to encourage social
feelings in her children, and during holiday
times would treat them to some of these
parties. It was her desire that all belonging
to her family should be united in love, and
an affectionate regard for each other; this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
she knew could not be the case unless they
were brought frequently together: and as
her boys were absent the greater part of the
year, she embraced the opportunity of school
vacations, to give them, not a dance, not a
supper table covered with all the luxuries
of the season—she could not bear to see children
gormandize, as eating immoderately
is called; her object was to bring them together,
and make them happy in a rational
way.</p>

<p>She interested herself on such occasions,
in composing for them puzzles, which had
infolded in them, some moral or religious
precept: she treated them to apples, nuts,
and sugar plums, and nice cakes; but then,
these were the least part of the entertainment.
She never left them to themselves to
romp and disturb the neighbours with their
noise; but would remain with them, to moderate
the buoyancy of their spirits, and direct
them in their innocent sports. She
would once or twice during the evening,
gather them around the table, and play
teacher, while they were her scholars. This
would lead to many useful questions and
answers, and it must have been a very stupid
child, who would go away without some instruction.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Nine o’clock was the hour she
fixed, for the young people to separate, and
they seldom infringed upon these limits. Mrs.
B. was so much respected and beloved by all
young folks, that whatever she said was a law
to them.</p>

<p>Christmas day was bright and clear; the
children were in fine spirits, and their parents
happy in seeing them so.</p>

<p>In the evening, when all was still, when
the table was drawn close beside a good fire,
when the curtains were closed, and Mrs. B.
was seated in the corner of the sofa which
she usually occupied, with her four children
around her, the following dialogue commenced.</p>

<p>“I believe all my children, except little
Mary, know why this is called <em>Christmas
day</em>.” “And I know too, mamma,” said a little
girl, of six years old: “do you dear,” said
her mother, “then you shall tell me why?”
“I have heard you tell my brothers and
Emma that Christ was supposed to be born
on that day.” “That is right, and you are a
good girl, for noticing, and remembering my
instructions. Emma, can you tell me where he
was born?” “In the town of Bethlehem, in the
country of Judea.” “Can you tell me any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of the circumstances which attended his
birth, George?” “He was born in a stable,
because there was no room for him in the inn:
and he was wrapt in swaddling clothes, and
laid in a manger.” “When we think,” said
Mrs. Barrington, “that the Lord of heaven
and earth was born in a stable, should it not
make us thankful, that he has provided more
comfortable accommodations for us? It should
also teach us humility, when we consider,
that we are in comparison but worms of the
dust; and that it is his goodness which supplies
us with every thing needful to shelter
and comfort us.” “Mamma,” said Emma,
“what do you mean by humility?” “That
we should not pride ourselves on what we
possess, because we know that it is all given
to us by God, or rather lent to us, as long as
he chooses we should have it. For the Scriptures,
which are the word of truth, say, that
‘the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.’
To be humble is to be meek, not
thinking ourselves better than others. You
know Mr. Eastburne; I call him an humble
man, he is lowly minded, and meek, and is
constantly going about following the example
of his Saviour, doing good to every one.
Yet he never talks about himself, or what he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
has done; and if you would meet him without
knowing who he was, you would, from his
appearance, think he had no pretensions to
the character he has obtained; he is so unostentatious,
and so <em>humble</em>, that to learn
something of him, you would have to go to the
house of the sick person he has been visiting,
or the poor family for whom he is interesting
himself, not only occasionally, but almost
every day of his life.”</p>

<p>“How delightful it must be to have such a
character, to be so good, and so humble,
Mamma,” said Howard. “Yes, my child,
and all may be so if they endeavour to keep
the commandments of God, and ask his blessing
on the endeavour. Howard, it is now
your turn to answer. Can you tell me the
object of our Saviour’s birth?” “He came to
save all mankind from their sins, all that
would repent, and believe.” “Were the
parents of Jesus living at Bethlehem, at the
time of his birth?” “No, mamma, they were
living at Nazareth, a town in Galilee, but
Augustus the Roman Emperor, made a decree,
that all the world should be taxed, and
that every one must go to his own city for this
purpose. Now Joseph and Mary, the parents
of Jesus, the Scriptures say, belonged to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
lineage of David, and Bethlehem was the city
of David, and they went there to be taxed,
just before our Saviour’s birth.” “Do you
understand, my dear Howard, what is meant
by the word <em>lineage</em>, and what was understood
by their being taxed at this time?”
“Not perfectly, will you explain it to me,
mamma?” “The lineage, or <em>line of David</em>,
which is the common expression, as applied
to Joseph and Mary, mean that they belonged
to his family. Many hundred years before
Christ was born, the Prophet Isaiah, a
man who was inspired by God, predicted in
the Scriptures of the Old Testament, that
Christ would be born of one of the descendants
of this family, that is of the <em>line</em> or family
of David, and that he would be born in
Bethlehem, the city to which David’s family
belonged, and here it was they came to be
taxed, although they had been living at
Nazareth, a distance of sixty or seventy
miles from Bethlehem. Augustus had issued
a decree, or law, that an account should
be taken of the number, and situations, of all
the subjects, or persons, in his vast empire,
which from ostentation he called <em>all the
world</em>, because it contained the best, and
most civilized, and cultivated countries then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
known, this was the second decree he had
sent out, and so many persons had they to
number, and register or put down in a book,
that they were three years before they came
to Bethlehem. At this time, only their
names were taken; they were not required
to pay any thing till twelve years after: when
they did pay, it was for the support of the
kingdom, to enrich it, and enable its monarchs
to live in splendour. Taxing is lawful,
when the money, or other things required,
is not so much as to bear heavily
on the poor, who are not able to bear
it. Our Saviour sanctions it, when he
says, ‘render unto Cæsar the things which
are Cæsar’s.’ But it has been carried so far,
under despotic governments, and even in
countries, which at this day we have constant
intercourse with, that it is melancholy even
to think of the distress it has occasioned the
poor; who at some seasons, have scarce been
able to get bread enough to keep them from
starving.” “Thank you, mamma, I shall
endeavour to remember what you have told
me.”</p>

<p>“George, can you tell me how the birth of
our Saviour became known?”—“Did not
the shepherds tell it to all they met, mamma.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, but how did they know it?”
“Angels,” said Howard, “told it to them:—they
were watching their flocks, at night,
to keep them from the wolves.” “Would
you not think it hard to be out on a winter’s
night, Howard?” “I should not have suffered
so much there, as here; the climate is so
much warmer.” “But, I think,” said Mrs. B.
“you said the shepherds were watching their
flocks?”—“Yes, mamma, and while they
were watching, an angel appeared to them:
they were frightened at first, but the angel
told them not to be afraid.” “Cannot you
repeat the passage of Scripture?” “Yes,
mamma, it is in the 2nd chapter of St. Luke,
and the 10th and 11th verses:—‘Fear not,
for behold, I bring you good tidings of great
joy, which shall be to all people: for unto
you is born, this day, in the city of David, a
Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.’” “Do
you recollect what took place after this?”
“The shepherds exceedingly rejoiced, and
went to Bethlehem where they found the
Babe, with his father and mother; precisely
in the situation which had been foretold; the
shepherds then told the great news to all
they knew.” “Do you recollect, Howard,
what is said of Simeon, a devout man, who is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
spoken of, in the 2nd chapter of Luke, which
records the nativity, or birth of our Saviour?”
“When the parents of Jesus brought him up
to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, and
offer a sacrifice for him, which the law required,
Simeon was dwelling at Jerusalem,—but,
mamma, I would rather hear you relate
this.”</p>

<p>“You were right, so far, my dear: Simeon
was a believer in Christ when he was yet unborn;—he
had studied the prophets of the
old Testament, and as the Scripture says,
‘he was waiting for <em>the consolation of Israel</em>,’
that meant, to <em>see Christ</em>; for it had been revealed
to him that he should not see death,
until he had seen the Lord’s Christ.</p>

<p>“When the young child was brought into
the temple, Simeon, it is said, was led by the
Spirit to go there. George, do you repeat
what the good old man said, when his eyes
beheld the Babe of Bethlehem, as our infant
Saviour was called.”</p>

<p>“I will try, mamma: he took him up in his
arms, and blessed God, saying, ‘Lord, now
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according
to thy word, for mine eyes have seen
thy salvation.’” “The Scriptures have said
that when Jesus was taken into the temple,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the law required that a sacrifice or offering
should be made for him,—what was this offering?”
“A pair of turtle doves, or two
young pigeons.” “Yes, my dear, the Jewish
law made it necessary to bring an offering
for every male child. The more wealthy
among them, gave a lamb of the first
year, and it shows how poor the parents of
Jesus were, that they were able to offer only
a pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.
When you are a little older, my dear children,
you will be better able to comprehend
the full meaning: of a sacrifice or offering,
and the connexion they had with the great
sacrifice of himself, which our blessed Saviour
made for sinful creatures such as we
are.</p>

<p>“What do you know, Howard, of the wise
men who came from the east in search of the
Babe of Bethlehem?” “They came to Jerusalem
first.” “Did they remain there?”
“No:—they told Herod, the king of Judea,
that Christ was born, for they had seen his
star in the east.” “Do you know what they
meant by that?” “Do you tell us, mamma.”
“It was at that time believed throughout all
the <em>East</em>, that some very extraordinary person
was to arise in Judea. The belief was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
founded on their having some knowledge of
the writings of the ancient prophets; and
from the Jews themselves, who were scattered
over all the eastern countries. Many
persons suppose these <em>wise men</em> lived in Persia,
a country a great deal further to the east
than Jerusalem. About the time they expected
this great personage to appear, they
saw a very shining, or luminous appearance
in the sky, which induced them to take this
very long journey. They thought by going
to Jerusalem first, they should certainly hear
every thing which had occurred.” “But,
mamma,” said George, “I thought Herod did
not know that Jesus was born.” “You are
right:—he was kept in ignorance of it, because
God knew that he was a wicked king,
and would destroy the young child, in order
to keep him from reigning as a temporal king,
as they supposed he would do, and by this
means overturn the Roman empire: the wise
men were warned of this, and seeing the same
light or star, which they saw in their own
country, they followed it, till it stood just
over the house where the young child lay;
for, by this time, his parents had found better
accommodations for him, than the poor stable
in which he was born. The scriptural relation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
is so beautiful, I will turn to it, and
read it to you, or, George, you may find the
place in the 2nd chapter of the gospel of Matthew.
‘When they saw the star, they rejoiced
with exceeding great joy. And when
they were come into the house, they saw the
young child, and Mary his mother, and they
fell down and worshipped him; and when
they had opened their treasures, they presented
unto him gifts, gold, and frankincense,
and myrrh.’” “Was not Herod very angry
when he found the wise men did not return
through Jerusalem, as he expected they
would?” “Yes, he was indeed: and, in consequence
of this, and that he might certainly
destroy the infant Saviour, he caused all the
young children, of two years of age, and all
under this age, to be destroyed. But God
did not allow him to succeed; for he sent
the parents of Jesus, with the young child,
into another country, out of Herod’s reach;
so that he escaped, when many other poor
children were cut off. A beautiful account
is given of this blessed child, in the 2nd chapter
of Luke, and the 2nd chapter of Matthew.</p>

<p>“His parents were in the habit of going up
to Jerusalem once a year, to the feast of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
passover, an ordinance which I will explain
to you when you are older. It was customary
for children to go with their parents to
this feast; and Jesus went with Joseph, and
Mary his mother, for he was, at that time,
twelve years old. A very interesting incident
occurred, when his father and mother
left the temple. But I wish each of you to
read one of the chapters I have mentioned.
I have been endeavouring to explain them to
you, and I hope you will now understand
them.”</p>

<p>After they had read these scriptures, the
children all joined in a hymn, which their
mother had composed for the day, and then
retired with her blessing.</p>

<p>Every day of the following week was passed
among their relatives, till the last day of
the old year arrived. The boys had then but
one day to remain at home; and on this day
the rain poured down in torrents. To a reflecting
mind, there is something in this period,
which fills the heart with a tender sorrow;
the youthful party, however, were as
yet strangers to any great concern either for
the past or future. Howard alone began to
feel; his mind was unusually matured, for
one of his age; and his character resembled
his mother’s in many respects; an extreme
delicacy of sentiment marked all his thoughts—and
an intuitive sense of pain his actions:
he never witnessed the dejection of another,
but he was sure to imbibe a portion of their
grief. The indigent widows who were his
mother’s pensioners, had always a ready
friend in him; and from quite a little child,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
he never beheld a poor ragged boy or girl,
that he did not wish to give them some of
his little clothes:—and one day, seeing a
poor beggar come into the hall, he ran before
any one was aware of it, and took from
the side-board, a loaf of bread, and carrying
it in his little apron, threw it into the
beggar’s lap. This disposition continued,
and now in his twelfth year, he is constantly
doing little acts of kindness to all within his
reach. Is it to be wondered at, that such a
boy, ensures to himself the good will of all
who know him?</p>

<p>At length <em>New Year’s</em> day came: this was
passed at home, with uncles, and aunts, and
cousins, a goodly number. After the day
was over, and the guests had all returned to
their homes, Howard and George lingered
round the fire, and their mother took the opportunity
to give them directions for their
conduct during the <em>New Year</em>, upon which
they had entered. It was such advice, as
every pious, and judicious parent, should
give to her sons, when on the eve of parting
from them. She bade them call to mind the
past year, and think how often they had offended
against God; how many times they
had broken his commandments; how often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
they had acted contrary to the advice of
their parents, and teachers, by breaking the
Sabbath, and by other acts of folly; which,
however trivial <em>in their eyes</em>, would not be
overlooked by God, “who is the searcher of
the thoughts and intents of the heart.”</p>

<p>In this manner the hours wore away, and
bed time arrived; the trunks were already
packed to be ready for the morning stage,
which was to convey the boys back to the
school, twelve miles distant from town:
next morning, a loud rap at the door of their
sleeping apartment, aroused Howard and
George, from most delicious slumbers; and
the bright sun darting his beams into the
windows, admonished them to arise.</p>

<p>Breakfast being over, and the trunks in
readiness in the hall, Harry was summoned:
after loitering, and holding mamma by the
hand as long as she would permit them, the
boys gave her a hasty kiss, and ran out of the
parlour into Dr. Barrington’s office—and embracing
him, were off. Harry followed with
the trunks, and they were shortly seated in
the very same <em>stage-coach</em>, which, the week
before, had brought them to town. Howard’s
eyes were suffused with tears, and
George looked grave. They however began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
to think of all the pleasures they had enjoyed.
George pleased himself with the thought
of how much he would have to tell the boys
at school; and Howard thought, if the next
day should be clear, he would walk over to
old Squire Hobson’s farm, and see his poor
tenant, William Jones, who was in a deep
decline. He had his pocket full of medicines
for him, that the Doctor had recommended,
but which he was too poor to purchase. These
his father had allowed him to take from his
own stock that he always kept for the indigent.
Howard had beside, a large roll of
flannel in his trunk, which his mamma had
placed there for William Jones’s two youngest
children; and Howard also thought to
himself, how sweet it will be to carry my
nice <em>New Testament</em> to the farmer’s, and
read to poor William.</p>

<p>The stage now stopped at the door of the
village pastor’s house; and the next morning
the boys entered upon their studies, in the
school-room adjoining: nor were they unmindful
of that God to whom their mother
had directed their thoughts, <em>as the source of
all their blessings for time and eternity</em>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
